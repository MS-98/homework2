<p>The fennec fox, also known as the desert fox, is a beautiful, small member of the vulpine family. Fennec foxes can be kept as pets, although they are not very common. They are petite, save for their enormous ears. They behave much like dogs, but since they are not domesticated, they do require careful socialization as well as precautions against escape. As always, before deciding on adopting one of these beautiful little animals, be sure you are legally allowed to keep them where you live.  <a href='https://www.thespruce.com/about-fennec-foxes-as-pets-1236778'> More...</a></p>
